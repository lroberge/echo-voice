# echo-voice
A voice changer for Warforged characters in D&D, built using Electron.  
(My specific interpretation of Warforged voices, obviously.)

## Methodology
It's literally just a comb filter on top of a pitch shift.  
The delay on the comb filter ("roboticness"), as well as the octave of the pitch shift, can be altered to help produce varied voices among multiple Warforged.
